# Guess-pick-win-
Everyone has considered themselves a lucky person at least once in their lifetime, but how long does their luck last? In our application, users can challenge their luck and see how far it will take them. In this project, the computer picks a random number in a specified set of integers from 1 to any number that the user likes. The user has the opportunity to guess the selected number. The count of the highest correct answers in a row is the high score, and the goal is breaking your own record. The app will congratulate the user once they break the high score. If the user guesses incorrectly, the score will restart, and they can start again.
